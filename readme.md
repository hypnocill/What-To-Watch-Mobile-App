## About the project

It's mostly a personal project made with React-Native and its ecosystem.

The app is available only on Android at the moment.

It 'recommends' you a random movie with a review by the users. You can also pick a movie genre.

It shows the movie cover screenshot fetched from an external api, the review itself, along with the user who submitted the review.

You can check to add the movie to your list and don't get it recommended again.

You have a list of all movies you've added to it.

Obviously you can add a movie review yourself. Once submitted successfully it's sent to a private endpoint where it needs to be manually approved. If approved, it goes live in the app where other users will be able to see it.

To use the full functionality of the app - you must log with facebook.

If you don't login with facebook, you can only use the random movie recommendation functionality.
