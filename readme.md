## About the project

It's a personal project for fun and react-native and redux practice.

The app is android only.

It 'recommends' you a random movie from all the stored movies ( though there are about 10 movie reviews :D )

It also shows a movie cover screenshot fetches from an external api. Also shows who has written the review.

You can check to add the movie to your list and don't get it recommended again.

That being said - you have a list of all movies you've added to it.

Obviously you can add a movie review yourself. Once sent, it requires an approval from me
and only then it gets into the app.

To use all the functionality of the app - you must log with facebook.

If you don't log with facebook, you can only use the random movie recommendation functionality.

## More info

This project is far from finished or polished. At places the code is messy, etc, but the main purpose of this
repository is to serve as an example of the used technologies put together in a working mobile app.
